        <p>
            I'm Amey, an incoming P.hD. student in cryptography at the <a href="https://www.cse.uconn.edu/">Department of Computer Science & Engineering</a>
            at
            the <a href="https://uconn.edu/">University of Connecticut</a>.
            I'm advised by <a href="https://benjamin-fuller.uconn.edu/">Dr. Benjamin Fuller</a>. 
            I am interested in building provably secure cryptographic protocols that
            address real-world problems
            using a deep understanding of practical considerations. My research interests are driven by the difficulty
            faced by engineers in handling
            the brittle and corner cases of cryptosystems in practice.
        </p>
        <p>
            &nbsp &nbsp My research is driven by the key observation that while cryptographers have created wonderful
            protocols that can do things once thought
            to be science fiction, in practice, these protocols are implemented by software engineers who are usually
            not experts in cryptography and often with limited time and with a limited budget.
            Our society increasingly depends on these protocols. The theoretical maximum of wonderful things a protocol
            can do is
            less important than how it's likely to perform in the hands of an engineer. My work focuses on making these
            tools into something
            better suited to the work of an industrial engineer.
        </p>
        <p>
            &nbsp &nbsp Right now, I am a master's student at the School of Computing at <a href="https://wichita.edu">Wichita State University</a>,
            advised by <a href="https://www.wichita.edu/profiles/academics/engineering/SoC/Salinas-Sergio.php">Dr. Sergio Salinas Monroy</a>.
            I am investigating private auction mechanisms for additive manufacturing and developing general game theory
            techniques to build a multi-time-
            step auction that can make decisions for future allocations based on past allocations. I have also spent
            time at <a href="https://www.netapp.com/">NetApp</a> bridging storage and
            networking.
